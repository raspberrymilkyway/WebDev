# WebDev
Stuff I made in my web-dev class, with personally identifying information taken out. Most of it works; some of it will not work (namely the PHP content) without a server.


Links to the other pages may or may not work; the folders with which we were to submit the projects were all nested within each other (because that was how they told us to do it, afaik). In particular, this pertains to the final project; the "Projects" tab on that does not work because I didn't change it; it is as it was when I uploaded it, minus a few instances of personally identifying information. Apologies if this causes issues.


Programmed in VS Code and Notepad++.
